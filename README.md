# LT2222 V23 Assignment 3

# Selecting features of the emails

To run the code use `python a3_features.py /scratch/lt2222-v23/enron_sample dataset 20 (--test 20)`

# Model construction

To run the code use ` python a3_model.py Train_corpus.csv Test_corpus.csv 20 1 ` 
#the final argument can 0, 1 or 2 depending on how many non-linearities are wanted. # Something happend while I was trying to run the code and the model started to present a error that was not there before. I think it i related to the features part of the assignment, but I couldn't identify it. 
 

# Part 4:
    There are some ethical issues related to use of the Enron corpus. The corpus were generated by people who worked at Enron Corporation. The problem with that is that even though the emails were "property" of the company, the employees who wrote the emails didn't give formal consent to be used for research. 
    
    The use of this corpus could result in the identification of the workers or even the exposure of their private information, which could harm them specially when the Enron scandal is considered and could have a big impact on those people's life. 

    Therefore, the use of this corpus for experiments can result in the violation of the confidentiality of those who exchanged emails using the company's email. And to take that into consideration is extremely important when researchers intend to use this corpus, so possible damages are minimized.
